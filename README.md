- **Input Format:**
	- The first line contains the asset tracking number, which is an integer.
	- The second line contains the asset name, which is a string.
	- The third line contains the asset value, which is a float number.
- **Output Format:**
	- The first line contains the asset tracking number input by the user.
	- The second line contains the asset name input by the user.
	- The third line contains the asset value input by the user.

**Sample Input**:
```
8511
Speaker
10099.99
```

**Sample Output**:
```
8511
Speaker
10099.99
```
